Ignition is a set of packages and modules that allows developers to get code completion for Ignition Scripting API scripting functions in their IDE of choice.

# Releases

Check the [releases page](https://github.com/thecesrom/Ignition/releases) and download the one for your current version.

If you can't find it, feel free to submit your request on our [Discussions](https://github.com/thecesrom/Ignition/discussions).

  * Or with Homebrew on macOS
    ```bash
    $ brew install --cask zulu11
    ```
* Jython
  * 2.7.1 for Ignition 8.0 through 8.1.7
    * Download [here](https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/python/jython-installer/2.7.1/jython-installer-2.7.1.jar)
    * Or via Homebrew
      ```bash
      $ brew install coatl-dev/coatl-dev/jython@2.7.1
      ```

    * Download [here](https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/python/jython-installer/2.7.1/jython-installer-2.7.2.jar)
    * Or via Homebrew
      ```bash
      $ brew install coatl-dev/coatl-dev/jython@2.7.2

* You are familiar with [Ignition 8.1 System Functions](https://docs.inductiveautomation.com/display/DOC81/System+Functions)

## Packages

Ignition consists of the following packages:

* com
* system

### com

These are libraries for some of Inductive Automation's Java packages and functions that are imported in `system` packages.

### system

Is a package that includes all Ignition Scripting Functions.

## Installation and usage

The preferred method is to install it by running `pip` by running `jython -m pip install` like this:

```bash
$ jython -m pip install https://github.com/thecesrom/Ignition/archive/refs/tags/v8.1.10-jython.post2.zip
```

This will install it as package to your Jython installation, which will allow you to call Ignition Scripting functions from Jython's REPL.

```bash
$ jython
Jython 2.7.2 (v2.7.2:925a3cc3b49d, Mar 21 2020, 10:03:58)
[OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (Azul Systems, Inc.)] on java11.0.12
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from __future__ import print_function
>>> import system.util
>>> print(system.util.__doc__)
Utility Functions.

The following functions give you access to view various Gateway and
Client data, as well as interact with other various systems.


>>> system.util.beep()
>>> quit()
```

And to uninstall:

```bash
$ jython -m pip uninstall ignition-api-jython
```
